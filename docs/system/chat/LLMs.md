# Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Purpose

Provide a reusable set of LLMs that can be used by the system easily for the right tasks. It should be easy to provide custom LLMs to the interface, and use local models in development.

## Access

LLMs should be accessible under custom for usage, subject to [Metering](../Metering.md) limits
